The cacheable rest plugin uses the cache-headers plugin to extend the functionality of RestfulController from
so that ETag and Last-Modified headers are sent when listing and viewing object.  It also takes advantage of the
cache-header's plugin's ability to process If-Not-Etag headers, increasing the cacheability and speed of your API.
